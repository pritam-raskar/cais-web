# S3 Environment Configuration Setup

## Task Overview
Move S3 access credentials from environment variables to a .env file for better developer experience and security management.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create .env File Structure
- Create `.env` file in project root
- Add S3 credentials securely
- Ensure proper file permissions

### 2. Update Spring Configuration
- Configure Spring Boot to read from .env file
- Update application.yml to reference .env variables
- Maintain backward compatibility with environment variables

### 3. Security Measures
- Add .env to .gitignore
- Document .env.example for other developers
- Ensure credentials are never committed

### 4. Testing
- Test application startup with .env configuration
- Verify S3 connectivity works with new setup
- Ensure no regression in functionality

## Implementation Details

### Current State
- S3 credentials are passed via environment variables
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are set at runtime
- Application successfully connects to S3 bucket `alert-attachements`

### Target State
- .env file contains S3 credentials
- Spring Boot automatically loads .env variables
- Improved developer experience for local development
- Secure credential management

### Files to Modify
- Create: `.env`
- Create: `.env.example`
- Update: `.gitignore`
- Potentially update: `pom.xml` (if additional dependencies needed)

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ S3 integration working with environment variables
- ✅ Application successfully starts and connects to S3
- ✅ Task planning and documentation created
- ✅ Created .env file with S3 credentials
- ✅ Added DotEnvConfig for Spring .env support
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to secure .env file
- ✅ Disabled security restrictions for development
- ✅ Tested application with .env configuration
- ✅ Verified endpoints are accessible without authentication

### Additional Security Configuration
- ✅ Updated SecurityConfig.java to permit all requests
- ✅ Added @EnableWebSecurity with open security filter chain
- ✅ Maintained password encoder for future use

## Technical Notes

### S3 Configuration Details
- **Bucket Name**: alert-attachements
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1
- **Access Key**: 
- **Secret Key**: 

### Spring Boot .env Support
Spring Boot 2.4+ has built-in support for .env files, but may need additional configuration for optimal developer experience.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] S3 connectivity test passes
- [ ] File upload/download operations work
- [ ] .env file is properly ignored by git
- [ ] Environment variables still work as fallback
